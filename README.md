# Currency Converter
[![CI](https://github.com/nywton/currency-converter-ruby/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nywton/currency-converter-ruby/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A lightweight Rails app that fetches exchange rates from [CurrencyAPI](https://currencyapi.com/) and caches them, enabling **unlimited conversions** without spending your API credits.

**Key Features**

- **Unlimited Conversions**: Rates are cached and refreshed once daily, so regardless of how many conversions you perform, youâ€™ll only consume CurrencyAPI credits once per day.

- **Simple REST API**:  
- **Full Currency Support**: Converts any currency available in CurrencyAPI.

Made with ðŸ’š for my friends at [Jaya.tech](https://jaya.tech/) intend to solve the challenge of currency conversion described in [INTRUCTIONS.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) file.

## Prerequisites

* Ruby 3.x
* A CurrencyAPI account (signup at [https://app.currencyapi.com](https://app.currencyapi.com))
* Your API key from the CurrencyAPI dashboard

---

## Configuration

1. Clone this repository or copy the `lib/exchange_rate_provider.rb` file into your project:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nywton/currency-converter-ruby
    cd currency-converter-ruby
   
    # checkout to the branch
    git checkout nywton_barros
   ```

2. Copy the example environment file

First, make a copy of the sample env file:

   ```bash
   cp sample.env .env
   ````

3. Visit the CurrencyAPI dashboard to retrieve your API key:

   ```bash
    # Open in browser:
    https://app.currencyapi.com/dashboard
   ```

Then open the newly created `.env` in your editor and set your `CURRENCY_API_KEY`:

```dotenv
CURRENCY_API_KEY="your_actual_currencyapi_key_here"
```

4. (optional) Export your API key as an environment variable for local development:

  ```bash
  export CURRENCY_API_KEY="your_actual_currencyapi_key_here"
  export JWT_SECRET_KEY="your_actual_jwt_secret_key_here"
  ```
---

**NOTE:** Currency API currently has limited free api calls. I will improve this by adding a cache layer to make possible unlimited rate convertions in a day.

## Installation

2. Docker setup:

Spin up the app inside Docker (no local Ruby install needed):

   ```bash
   # Build the image
   docker compose build
   
   # Start the app container
   docker compose up web
   
   # Run migrations
   docker compose exec web bin/rails db:create db:migrate
   ```

3. Local setup:

 Ensure you have `CURRENCY_API_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET` set in your environment:

   ```bash
   gem install bundler
   
   bundle install
   
   bin/rails db:create db:migrate
   ```
---

## Running

1. Docker:

   ```bash
   # Build the image
   docker compose up web
   
   # or
   docker compose run --rm web bin/rails server -b 0.0.0.0 -p 3000
   ```
2. Local:

   ```bash
   bin/rails server -b 0.0.0.0 -p 3000
   ```

3. Useful Docker commands:

   ```bash
   # 1. Build the image
   docker compose build
   # (optional) Build from scratch (no cache)
   docker compose build --no-cache
   
   # 2. Run migrations and seeds
   docker compose exec web bin/rails db:setup
   # (optional) if there are no running containers
   docker compose run --rm web bin/rails db:setup
   
   # 3. Run tests
   docker compose run --rm test
   
   # 4. Run rails server
   docker compose up web --remove-orphans
   
   # 5. Run rails console
   docker compose exec web bin/rails console
   # (optional) if there are no running containers
   docker compose run --rm web bin/rails console
   
   # 6. Stop the containers
   docker compose down
   # (optional) Stop & remove containers, networks, volumes and images
   docker compose down --rmi all --volumes --remove-orphans   
   ```

---

## Testing

We use RSpec for unit tests. Ensure you have the `rspec` gem installed:

Run the full test suite:

1. Docker:

   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm test
   ```

2. Local:

   ```bash
   bundle exec rspec
   ```

Or if you want run guard:

   ```bash
   bundle exec guard
   ```

A sample spec file lives at `spec/lib/fixtures/requests/currencyapi/get_latest_currency.json`, representing the response from the CurrencyAPI.

## CLI Usage

* NOTE: Ensure you have `CURRENCY_API_KEY` set in your environment.

* NOTE: Each execution will count as api calls to CurrencyAPI.

### Fetching Rates from CurrencyAPI

The ExchangeRateProvider class can be used to fetch exchange rates from CurrencyAPI.

* You can use the `latest` method to fetch all rates for a given base currency.

* The following examples show how to use the ExchangeRateProvider class.

1. Fetch all rates with Docker: (ensure you have `CURRENCY_API_KEY` set in your environment)

   ```bash
   # Default base is USD
   docker compose run --rm --remove-orphans web bin/rails runner "puts ExchangeRateProvider.new.latest"
   # => { "EUR" => 0.92, "BRL" => 5.50, ... }
   
   # Fetch specific base and targets:
   docker compose run --rm web --remove-orphans bin/rails runner "puts ExchangeRateProvider.new.latest(base: 'BRL', targets: ['USD', 'EUR'])"
   # => {"USD" => 0.1832108847, "EUR" => 0.1570722103}
   ```

2. Fetch all rates with local Ruby:

   ```ruby
   # in bash
   $ irb -r ./lib/exchange_rate_provider
   
   # in irb
   # 1. Instantiate the provider (uses Net::HTTP by default):
   provider = ExchangeRateProvider.new
   
   # 2. Fetch all rates (base USD):
   rates = provider.latest
   # => { "EUR" => 0.92, "BRL" => 5.50, ... }
   
   # 3. Fetch usd rates for specific targets:
   brl_rate = provider.latest(targets: 'BRL')
   # => { "BRL" => 5.50 }
   # 4. Fetch specific base and targets: (BRL/USD, BRL/EUR)
   provider.latest(base: 'BRL', targets: ['USD', 'EUR'])
   #=> {"EUR" => 0.1569435088, "USD" => 0.1817695646}
   ```

---
### Converting amounts

The ExchangeRateConverter class can be used to convert amounts using exchange rates fetched from CurrencyAPI.

* You can use the `convert` method to convert an amount from one currency to another.
* It makes possible to cache fetched rates to avoid making repeated requests to CurrencyAPI.
* The following examples show how to use the ExchangeRateConverter class.

1. Convert amounts with Docker:

   ```bash
   # Default base is USD. Convert 100 usd to brl:
   docker compose run --rm --remove-orphans web bin/rails runner "puts ExchangeRateConverter.new(ExchangeRateProvider.new.latest).convert(100, base: 'usd', target: 'brl')"
   # => 550.1471065
   
   # Convert specific base and target:
   docker compose run --rm --remove-orphans web bin/rails runner "puts ExchangeRateConverter.new(ExchangeRateProvider.new.latest).convert(100, base: 'brl', target: 'usd')"
   
   # Run from fixtures:
   ```

2. Convert amounts with local Ruby (irb):

this project also provides an `exchange_rate_converter` to perform amount conversions using fetched rates:

   ```ruby
   
   # in bash:
   $ irb
   
   # In irb:
   require_relative 'lib/exchange_rate_provider'
   require_relative 'lib/exchange_rate_converter'
   
   # 1. fetch the current rates:
   rates = ExchangeRateProvider.new.latest(base: 'usd', targets: %w[usd eur brl jpy])
   
   # 2. instantiate the converter with the rates:
   converter = ExchangeRateConverter.new(rates)
   
   # 3. convert 100 usd to brl:
   amount_in_brl = converter.convert(100, base: 'usd', target: 'brl')
   # => 550.1471065
   ```
